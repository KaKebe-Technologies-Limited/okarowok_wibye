## A Governance Structure Rooted in Tradition

The Okarowok Wibye Acel clan's approach to governance is a deliberate synthesis of ancestral wisdom and contemporary organisational practice. At its foundation lies the understanding that leadership is not a privilege of birth alone but a responsibility earned through demonstrated service, wisdom, and commitment to the community's welfare. The clan's 16-member executive structure reflects this philosophy, distributing authority across a council that includes elders, youth representatives, and women's voices — ensuring that no single generation or gender monopolises decision-making.

## The 16-Member Executive: Roles and Responsibilities

The executive council is composed of the Clan Chief (_Rwot_), Deputy Chief, Secretary General, Treasurer, and twelve additional portfolio holders covering areas such as cultural affairs, land and environment, youth development, women's empowerment, education, health, and diaspora relations. Each portfolio holder is accountable to the full council and to the clan assembly (_kacoke_), which meets annually to review progress and set priorities. This structure ensures that the clan's diverse interests are represented and that decisions are made through consensus rather than unilateral authority.

## Empowering the Next Generation

One of the most significant innovations in the Okarowok governance model is the formal inclusion of youth in leadership roles. Historically, clan leadership was the exclusive domain of elders, with young people expected to listen and learn. While respect for elders remains central to Lango culture, the clan has recognised that the challenges of the twenty-first century — digital literacy, urban migration, legal advocacy, and international networking — require skills that younger members often possess in greater measure. The Youth Development portfolio holder sits at the executive table with full voting rights, and youth representatives participate in all major deliberations.

## Success Stories from the Field

The results of this inclusive model are already visible. Under the leadership of the current executive, the clan has successfully registered its land boundaries with the Uganda Land Commission, launched a scholarship fund that has supported twelve students through university, and established a legal aid desk that has helped clan members navigate land disputes and inheritance cases. Young leaders who cut their teeth in the clan's youth committee have gone on to serve in local government, civil society organisations, and the private sector — carrying the values of _coo_ (integrity) and _kwo_ (communal responsibility) into their professional lives.

## Building Leaders for the Future

The clan's leadership development programme includes mentorship pairings between senior elders and promising young members, annual leadership retreats where governance principles are taught alongside practical skills, and a formal succession planning process that ensures continuity when executive members complete their terms. The Okarowok model is increasingly cited by other Lango clans as a template for effective, inclusive governance — proof that traditional structures can evolve without losing their essential character.
