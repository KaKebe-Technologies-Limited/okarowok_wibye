## The Duiker in Lango Cosmology

The red duiker (_Cephalophus natalensis_), known in Lango as _lyec me got_ or simply by its totem name within the Okarowok clan, occupies a unique place in the clan's spiritual and cultural life. As the clan's primary totem animal, the duiker is not merely a creature of the bush — it is a living symbol of the clan's identity, a messenger between the human and ancestral worlds, and a reminder of the covenant between the Okarowok people and the natural environment they inhabit. To harm a duiker is, for an Okarowok member, a serious transgression with spiritual consequences.

## Myths and Stories of the Duiker

Lango oral tradition is rich with stories featuring the duiker as a protagonist. In one widely told tale, a duiker leads a lost hunter back to his village by running just ahead of him through the forest, always visible but never catchable — a story interpreted as evidence of the duiker's role as a guide and protector of the clan. In another tradition, the founding ancestor Oculi Abwango is said to have received a vision in which a duiker appeared to him and revealed the boundaries of the clan's ancestral territory, marking each boundary point with a distinctive call. These stories are not dismissed as mere folklore; they encode important ecological and geographical knowledge in memorable narrative form.

## The Ecological Reality

Beyond its cultural significance, the duiker plays an important ecological role in the forests and woodlands of the Lango sub-region. As a browser and seed disperser, the duiker contributes to forest regeneration and biodiversity. Its presence in an area is an indicator of healthy woodland cover and the absence of heavy hunting pressure. The decline of duiker populations in parts of northern Uganda — driven by habitat loss, bushmeat hunting, and the disruption of traditional conservation practices during the LRA conflict — is therefore both an ecological and a cultural concern for the Okarowok clan.

## Traditional Conservation Practices

The totem system has historically served as an effective conservation mechanism. Because Okarowok members are prohibited from hunting or eating the duiker, a significant portion of the human population in the clan's territory has always refrained from hunting this species. This prohibition, multiplied across generations and across the many clans that maintain animal totems, created a distributed network of protected species that functioned as an informal wildlife management system long before Uganda had a formal conservation law. The Okarowok clan is working to document and revitalise these traditional conservation practices as part of its broader environmental stewardship programme.

## Conservation in the Twenty-First Century

The clan's Wildlife and Nature Committee collaborates with the Uganda Wildlife Authority and local environmental organisations to monitor duiker populations in the clan's territory, combat illegal bushmeat hunting, and restore degraded woodland habitats. Community members are educated about the ecological importance of the duiker alongside its cultural significance — reinforcing the message that protecting the totem animal is both a spiritual obligation and a practical contribution to environmental health. The clan's vision is a landscape where duikers move freely through healthy forests, where the old stories are still told around evening fires, and where the covenant between the Okarowok people and their natural world remains unbroken.
