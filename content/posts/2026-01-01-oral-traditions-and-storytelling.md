## The Living Archive of the Lango People

For generations, the Okarowok Wibye Acel clan has carried its history not in written volumes but in the voices of its elders. Oral tradition — _ngero_, proverbs, clan genealogies, and ceremonial songs — forms the backbone of Lango cultural identity. These stories are not mere entertainment; they encode laws, moral codes, land boundaries, and the spiritual relationships between the living and the ancestors. Every gathering around the fireplace was a classroom, and every elder a custodian of irreplaceable knowledge.

## Proverbs as Pillars of Wisdom

Lango proverbs (_ngero_) distil centuries of collective experience into compact, memorable phrases. Sayings such as _"Dano ma pe winyo lok pa ludit pe twero doko ladit"_ — "One who does not heed the counsel of elders cannot become an elder" — carry profound guidance for community life. These proverbs govern conflict resolution, marriage negotiations, land stewardship, and the raising of children. The clan's elders have long used them as gentle correctives, reminding younger members of their responsibilities to the community and to the ancestors who came before them.

## The Challenge of the Digital Age

Urbanisation, formal schooling conducted in English, and the pervasive influence of social media have created a generational gap in the transmission of oral knowledge. Young people who grow up in Kampala or Lira town may never sit at the feet of a grandparent and hear the full genealogy of the Okarowok lineage recited from memory. The risk is real: when the last keeper of a particular story passes on without a successor, that story is gone forever. The clan recognises this as one of the most urgent cultural challenges of our time.

## Technology as a Bridge, Not a Replacement

The Okarowok Wibye Acel clan has embarked on a deliberate programme to use digital tools as a bridge between generations. Elders are recorded on video and audio as they narrate clan histories, recite genealogies, and perform ceremonial songs. These recordings are catalogued and stored in a digital archive accessible to clan members across Uganda and the diaspora. The project is careful to distinguish between content that is freely shareable and sacred knowledge that must remain within the clan's custodianship — respecting the protocols that have always governed the transmission of sensitive cultural information.

## Keeping the Fire Burning

Technology alone cannot preserve culture; it must be paired with living practice. The clan organises annual storytelling festivals where elders and youth share the stage, and where children are encouraged to memorise and recite proverbs in Lango. Schools in the Okarowok ancestral territory are being engaged to incorporate clan history into their cultural programmes. The goal is not to freeze tradition in amber but to keep it alive and evolving — ensuring that the wisdom of Oculi Abwango and the founding ancestors continues to guide the Okarowok people through the challenges of the twenty-first century.
